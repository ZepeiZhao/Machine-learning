co-worker: Mingjun Liu, Minghong Xu, Zhixin Xie

Abstract: The main purpose of this study is to compare the performance of two algorithms, support vector machines(SVM) and neural networks (NN), for handwritten number recognition. In this study, SVM and ANN were used as the comparison items, and the data were preprocessed based on PCA and binary scaling. This experiment constructed a hand-written Digits Recognition Model based on two algorithms to measure the actual handwritten digital images. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of NN is better than that of SVM, and the time of computation was greatly reduced when the data set was dimensionality reduced by PCA.
